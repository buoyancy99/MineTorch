# MineTorch
Minetorch is a blockyly programming platform for children to learn and integrate deep learning models into their projects

Project based on pytorch and blockly

To use, you can click on NN toolbox on the left side, drag some boxes like in the demo image. After you are satisfied with your project you can click on "python" on the top bar to see the pytorch code generated. 

The project is on development and you cannot yet execute it directly on browser. However, we have shown some backend code in mine_torch which provides a high level api wrapper for pytorch. Connecting the generated code and libarary would be implemented  in official release

This project won the pytorch summer hackthon as the thrid place.
