# MineTorch
Minetorch is a Blockly programming platform for children to learn and integrate deep learning models into their projects.
Project-based on PyTorch and Blockly.
To use, you can click on NN toolbox on the left side, drag some boxes like in the demo image. After you are satisfied with your project you can click on "python" on the top bar to see the PyTorch code generated.
The project is in development and you cannot yet execute it directly on the browser. However, we have shown some backend code in mine_torch which provides a high-level API wrapper for PyTorch. Connecting the generated code and library would be implemented in the official release
This project won the PyTorch summer hackathon in third place.
